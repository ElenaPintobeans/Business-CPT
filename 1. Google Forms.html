<P ALIGN="CENTER"> Reflection:
<P ALIGN="CENTER"> I chose this piece of work to display because I believe that this shows my skills on being able to use the information I am given so I can organize and plan for editing my literature pieces based on the clients opinions.  I think that this will help me to move forward in my career because it is important to be completely aware of the needs of your clients and I was taught a very efficient way of doing that </P>
